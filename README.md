# Password Generator

## Description

This repository was created to add more javascript code to the pre-existing files to create a function that would make the "Generate Password" button functional. 

You can use the commits to follow my journey.



### How did I do it?

I created the generatePassword function and used string variables, the built in prompt function, if statements, if/elseif statements, and return statements to achieve random password generation. 

If you wish to visit the website you can do so by following this link: https://emmerz6949.github.io/password-generator/ .



### Installation and Usage

There isn't anything to install as this is just a website that has been deployed.

To use the password generator click on the link in the "How did I do it?" section of this README.md, then click the "Generate Password" button on the website and answer a series of prompts. After all prompts have been answered you will receive an appropriate outcome.



### Credits

The html and css files as well as some of the javascript code were provided by Trilogy Education Services (https://www.trilogyed.com/).
